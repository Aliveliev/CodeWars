'''
    There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

    find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
    find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
    Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

    The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

    This is the first kata in series:

    Find the unique number (this kata)
    Find the unique string
    Find The Unique
